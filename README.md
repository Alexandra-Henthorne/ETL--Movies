# ETL--Movies

The purpose of this project was to clean the movie database . We were isloating the budget, rating and movies themselves. Although I was not able to complete the full challenge because it kept telling me a line was basically being used before it was assigned. I was able to complete the module part just fine and all other data but could not figure out this one line or where it went wrong. I have uploaded both the challenge and module pythons to hope someone can see where I went wrong or if it was a program proble.

But i did understand the purpose of cleaning a massive movie database file and isolating  a movie based off of its ratings , budget and time.
